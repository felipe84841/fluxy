Hello :)
=======

FLUXY is a lightweight Python Multi Agent Framework. It abstracts from the concrete message transport layer, thus
more or less any message oriented middleware can easily be used with it. Just extend the "abstract"
MTL/MTLActor classes. For the moment it comes with a binding to ZeroMQ.

Being an Organization Centric MAS solution FLUXY is inspired by MaDKit.
Similar to MaDKit it implements the Agent/Group/Role (AGR) model.
Any number of agents can be members of any number of groups where they can have an arbitrary of roles in.

FLUXY also enables a consequently asynchronous coding style.

Agents in FLUXY have identities referring to the roles the agents play in groups. Associated with each identity of
an agent is a Behaviour which consists of ActionPatterns and ReactionPatterns.

There are InformMessages (one-way messages) and Request-/RequestReplyMessages (request-respond messaging) in FLUXY.

There is a minimal internal DSL for the messaging use cases that should help to keep the code readable.

FLUXY is still in ALPHA-stage.


Requirements:
============

- Python 2.7
- ZeroMQ / pyzmq


Usage:
